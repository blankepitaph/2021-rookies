# r/cow's Unofficial 2021 All-Rookie Team voting

### u/blankepitaph

This repo contains data and code for the unofficial All-Rookie Team
voting on [r/CompetitiveOverwatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/p68ela/unofficial_owl_2021_allrookie_team_voting_make/). 

`rookies_long.tsv` and `rookies_position_ranks.tsv` contain the raw and
summarised data, respectively. `rookies_long.tsv` was generated by running
`transform.py` on the Google Form output. Finally, `analysis.Rmd` contains
the code for data wrangling and visualization.

`plots/` contains what its name suggests while `team_logos` contains all
the team logos as `.png` files for use with the plots.
